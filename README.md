 ## Features

 ### Navigation

 ### Testing
 - I tested this page in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
 - Unfortunatly I couldn't get the website to be fully responsive so at the moment it it's somewhat responsive on an IPhone XR.
 - I have tested the Google maps embedded code and can locate the castle.

#### Validator Testing
>
##### HTML 
- I discovered a number of errors with my code when putting it through the W3C Validator. The main errors included me leaving out the alt attribute for the images that i had included in my webpage.
- The other errors were relating to using the div and h1 elements as a child to span which wasm't good practice in HTML5.
>
##### CSS
- I had no errors in my stylesheet when passing code through the W3C CSS Validator.
>
##### Accessibility
- I confirmed the colors and fonts chosen were easy to read and accessibly by running it through lighthouse in Devtools.
