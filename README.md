 >### Navigation
>![Alt text](/assets/images/nav-menu.PNG)
>- The navigation links are featured on the top of the website. They will guide the user to the required section of the website. When the user hovers over the navigation links the mouse pointer changes and the font color changes to grey. 
>- The font chosen is Teko and it's also applied to the entire font on the site. I chose this font as, to me it looks like it closely resembled scripts from the past.
>- The navigation section also includes the Kilkenny Castle Logo which is unresponsive. and a search feature.
>- And finally the webpage title rests on top of the navigation menu in green font on a floralwhite background.

>### Container

>#### Validator Testing
>
>##### HTML 
>- I discovered a number of errors with my code when putting it through the W3C Validator. The main errors included me leaving out the alt attribute for the images that i had included in my webpage.
>- The other errors were relating to using the div and h1 elements as a child to span which wasm't good practice in HTML5.
>
>##### CSS
>- I had no errors in my stylesheet when passing code through the W3C CSS Validator.
>
>##### Accessibility
>- I confirmed the colors and fonts chosen were easy to read and accessibly by running it through lighthouse in Devtools.
